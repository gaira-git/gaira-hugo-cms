  text: >-
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  heading: GAIRAについて
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
